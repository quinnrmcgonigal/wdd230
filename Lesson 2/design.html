        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <h3>Apple</h3>
        <p>Hick's law says the fewer choices a user has the better. On apples website they give you 2 main options, the iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13.</p>

        <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
        <h3>K2</h3>
        <p>Fitt's law uses human movement to draw attention. On K2's website they have a automatically playing video showing professionals using their new skis. This urges the users to click on the video as it's the first thing their eyes are drawn to.</p>

        <h2>Simple & Clean Design</h2>
        <h3>RED</h3>
        <p>I think RED's website is perfect for this. While all 3 of these websites can illustrate this I really like how RED put their menu option on the right side, which with a majority of the people in the world being right handed this makes sense.</p>
